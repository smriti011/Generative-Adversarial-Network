# Generative-Adversarial-Network
Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) represent a cutting-edge approach to generative modeling within deep learning, leveraging architectures like convolutional neural networks. The goal of generative modeling is to autonomously identify patterns in input data, enabling the model to produce new examples that feasibly resemble the original dataset.
